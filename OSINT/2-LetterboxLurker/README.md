# OSINT/3
This is the README for OSINT/3.

FLAG: parsec{geraint_chris_westminster}


### Question

I was on a trip to the UK before COVID hit and I came across some an interesting shiny postbox. I did not pay much attention to it but it was in the back of my head. Some one and a half years ago, I visited the UK again and I came across this red, white and blue postbox. My friend told me the Royal Mail paints these for special occasions and it has been a thing for quite a while now. Very intruiging! I started a hunt for similar such postboxes and came across different colours as well. Your job here is to:
- Find the specially painted shiny postboxes _closest to_ the ones painted red, white and blue, and
  - if they were associated with a person, enter their first names (in alphabetical order) (e.g., if two of them were painted in honour of John Doe and Michael Smith, append john_michael)
  - if they were associated with a place, enter the first word of the place (in alphabetical order) (E.g. if two of them were painted in relation to Church Street, Vatican City, append church_vatican)
  - then, sort all words in alphabetical order
  - Finally, the flag will be parsec{church_john_michael_vatican}
  
### How do I find the postboxes?

1. The red white and blue postboxes were made for the King's coronation in May 2023.
2. Searching up news sites, the locations of the red, white and blue postboxes are revealed.
3. We have to find more commemorative postboxes
