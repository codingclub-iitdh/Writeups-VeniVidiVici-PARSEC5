# Sober Up - Reverse Engineering
My friend recently opened a liquor store and asked me to review his menu. However, when I downloaded and opened the file later that day, the PDF was not viewable. When I asked him about it, he said there were copyright issues and that it wasn’t ready for commercial release. However, I have a feeling there’s something more going on beneath the surface.
